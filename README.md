This dashboard is to be used for research while the market is closed. "Stocks" page is used to generate technical analysis data for RSI, 50 & 200 day EMA, Bollinger Bands, etc. Data is pulled from the Alpha Vantage API and then saved to an Excel spreadsheet. The next step is to load the spreadsheet into Tableau for analysis. "Visuals" generates a condlestick chart using Plotly. Stock data is pulled using the Alpha Vantage API. "Stock Screener" uses yfinance and yahoo_fin to pull earnings history, financial stats, and news on desired stock. Also generates a list of undervalued large cap stocks. "Machine Learning" is used to predict stock prices for the next day using sklearn and keras. The model is very accurate if running the same stock over and over. It loses accuracy if running multiple stocks due to different data sets and patterns.
